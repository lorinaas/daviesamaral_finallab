                        Fall Guys (formerly known as Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout) is a free-to-play platform battle
                        royale game developed by Mediatonic. The game involves up to 60 players who control
                        jellybean-like creatures and compete against each other in a series of randomly selected
                        mini-games, such as obstacle courses or tag. Players are eliminated as the rounds progress
                        until, eventually, the last remaining player is crowned the winner. The game draws inspiration
                        from game shows like Takeshi's Castle, It's a Knockout, Wipeout, and playground games like tag
                        and British Bulldog.

                    <p class="lb_text">
                        Season 2: Satellite Scramble is the eighth Season of Fall Guys. It began after Season 1 ended on
                        15 September 2022 and was succeeded by Season 3. It is also unofficially known as Season 8 by
                        many legacy players, continuing the numbering from Legacy seasons, as well as the game version
                        number.</p>

                    <p class="lb_text">
                        The season pass is now 200 tiers long, with 145 free tiers and 55 paid tiers. From Tier 100 and
                        onward consists mainly of 30 crown shards to help users with progress on crown ranking.</br>
                        The concept of "vaulted rounds" is introduced, and the full round pools of Solo Show, Squads
                        Show and Duos Show is replaced with a seasonal variant of each (named Satellite Scramble
                        Shows).</br>
                        Repeatable challenges were added, making their first appearance in the second instance of Crown
                        Shard Scramble.</br>
                        After the version 8.2 update, the round loading screen during final rounds were given a new
                        look. It now has a crown beside the round's name, a golden plate on the "Final Round" text, and
                        a new yellow gradient with crowns as its background.</p>
