Final: Video Games

Assignment Description:

Work with ONE other person as a team. DO NOT use the same partners as you did for the
midterm - pick someone else.
Alternatively, work on your own with 2 github accounts (if you have them).
Create a Github repo with a well-written ReadMe file; add your partner as a collaborator.
You will be building a 1-page app about Video Games. Each of you will pick a unique video
game.
Update the readme with a brief description of what you’re building; edit the rest as you see
fit.
Use the provided build as your starting point; use branches, commits and pull requests to
complete the requirements as described below.
Update the sprite (provided) with video game images (four at minimum) and provide an
animation (transition or keyframe animation) on hover. Change the layout of that part of the
page to fit - update the CSS as it’s currently designed for the Marvel build.
Do something different with that part of the layout.
When clicked, the selected image should show some kind of visual update using the ::after
and :checked pseudo classes.
A lightbox should open with more information about the selected video game and its plot.
Make sure you merge everything to the main branch and submit the link.
